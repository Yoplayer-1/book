# Some ideas that I came up with
***
> [!NOTE]
> Checked items are planned to be implemented.

[] Weasley twins - Hardy boys

[] The vanishing toilet thingy used by death eaters to enter the castle - Wardrobe to Narnia

[] Hagrid - Giant from Jack and the Beanstalk

[] Dumbledore - Like Gandalf but not Gandalf

[] Alastor Moody in the Triwizard book- I always keep a gun in my nightstand in case of intruders, so I could shoot myself instead of meeting new people [^1]
