# Some ideas that I came up with
***
> [!NOTE]
> Checked items are planned to be implemented.

- [x] Convince friend to co-author the book.

- [ ] Weasley twins - Hardy boys

- [ ] The vanishing toilet thingy used by death eaters to enter the castle - Wardrobe to Narnia

- [ ] Hagrid - Giant from Jack and the Beanstalk

- [ ] Dumbledore - Like Gandalf but not Gandalf

- [ ] Alastor Moody in the Triwizard book- I always keep a gun in my nightstand in case of intruders, so I could shoot myself instead of meeting new people [^1]

- [ ] Nico helps Harry summon his parents in the last book instead of the resurrection stone.
