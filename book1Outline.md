## Chapter One: Number 5, Public Walk (or The Boy Who Lived?)

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number five, Public Walk were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the
last people you'd expected to be involved in anything strange or
mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called "Dursley's Colonization services". 
He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.
Mrs. Dursley was thin and bony and compensated for her husbands lack of neck by having a unusually large neck which she used to spy on the neighbours, craning her neck over the garden fence.
They also had a little boy, Dudley, with thick curly blond hair and in their opinion he was the bestest boy ever.

The Dursleys had everything, a comfortable life, tea and **... more tea?**. But they also had a fear, Mrs. Dursley's sister, Mrs. Potter. They couldn't bear to think what would happen if anyone found out about the Potters and their relation with the Dursleys, because they were a strange little family, the Potters. In fact Mrs. Dursley acted as though she didn't have a sister at all because of their unDursleyish nature. They hadn't made contact in years, even though the Dursleys knew the Potters had a small son, this whom they hadn't met yet but knew he was about as old as their little Duddley, and wanted to keep him from mixing with Duddly.
